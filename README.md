hlepor: Language-independent Model for Machine Translation Evaluation with Reinforced Factors
====================

introduction of hLEPOR: Language independent Model for Machine Translation Evaluation with Reinforced Factors

hLEPOR is a language independent machine translation evaluation metric with reinforced factors. hLEPOR is open source, 
free for research purpose. Experiments on ACL-WMT11 corpora (English to German, French, Spanish, Czech; and the reverse
direction) show hLEPOR yields higher correlation scores with human judgments at system-level, as compared to MPF, ROSE,
METEOR, BLEU, and TER evaluation metrics. Detailed knowledge of hLEPOR is shown in the paper "Language-independent Model
for Machine Translation Evaluation with Reinforced Factors" by Aaron Li-Feng Han, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Liangye
He, Yi Lu, Junwen Xing and Xiaodong Zeng. in Proceedings of the Machine Translation Summit XIV, pp. 215-222. Nice, France. 
International Association for Machine Translation. (Download paper http://www.mt-archive.info/10/MTS-2013-Han.pdf#!). If you use the 
hLEPOR metric in your researches, please cite the paper.

In the ACL-WMT 2013 Metrics Task (http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/metrics-task.html), hLEPOR (i.e. LEPOR_V3.1 in the 
Workshop report paper) also yields the highest Pearson correlation score with human judgment on the English-to-Russian 
language pair, in addition to the highest average-score on five language pairs 
(**English-to-German, French, Spanish, Czech, Russian**). The detailed results of WMT13 Metrics Task is introduced in
the paper "A Description of Tunable Machine Translation Evaluation Systems in WMT13 Metrics Task" by Aaron Li-Feng Han, 
Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Yi Lu, Liangye He, Yiming Wang and Jiaji Zhou, in Proceedings of ACL-WMT13
